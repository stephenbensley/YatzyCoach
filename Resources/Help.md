**Rules**
This app implements the common [American version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) of the Yatzy rules.

**To Roll the Dice**
Select the dice you wish to keep and click the Roll button. You can't roll zero dice, so if all dice are selected, the roll button will be disabled until you deselect at least one die.

**To Score the Dice**
Select an unused scoring category and click the Score button.

**Toolbar**
The toolbar at the top of the screen provides additional options:
|arrow.clockwise.circle| start a new game
|list.bullet.circle| detailed analysis of the current position
|info.circle| information about the app
|questionmark.circle| the screen you're reading now
|gearshape| settings for the Coach

**Credits**
This app was inspired by [An Optimal Strategy for Yahtzee](http://gunpowder.cs.loyola.edu/~jglenn/research/optimal_yahtzee.pdf) by James Glenn and [Optimal Solitaire Yahtzee Player](http://www-set.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/misc/yahtzee/osyp.php) by Tom Verhoeff. I did not use or even look at their source code, so any bugs in this app are entirely my own. However, all three of us arrived at the same solution for the expected score of solitaire Yahtzee with perfect play, so I'm confident that my code is correct.
